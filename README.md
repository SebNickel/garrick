# garrick
Command line flashcard app written in Python 3.

Named after Jay Garrick, aka The Flash, first of his monicker.

### Todo
* ~~Write install script~~
* Improve the card selection algorithm (current algorithm is a proof of concept, though it works fine).
* Allow easy editing ~~and deleting~~ of cards.
* Add a "single line mode", for entering cards with only one line on each side without the need to press Ctrl+D.

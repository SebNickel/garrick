Where is the configuration file for APT and dselect? What's in it? How might you go about modifying it?
[BACK]
/etc/apt/apt.conf

(and there's /etc/apt/sources.list, of course)

Contained options are grouped by curly braces, e.g.:

APT
{
	Get
	{
	    Download-Only "true";
	};
};

is equivalent to setting the --download-only option permanently.

Other than "man apt.conf", you can work from the example file
	/usr/share/doc/apt/examples/apt.conf
